I'm a systems neuroscientist interested in the neural mechanisms underlying learning and exploration. I am completing my PhD from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of [Israel Nelken](https://elsc.huji.ac.il/people-directory/faculty-members/israel-nelken/) and [Yonatan Loewenstein](https://elsc.huji.ac.il/people-directory/faculty-members/yonatan-loewenstein/).

In my PhD I study how rats learn a repeatedly changing mutli-step decision task, using computational principles from reinforcement learning. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors, I record neural activity from the orbitofrontal cortex as well as the secondary motor cortex in freely moving and behaving rats using untethered Neuropixels probes. I also use chemogenetic methods to perturb neural populations while animals perform the task.

I am especially interested in how neural populations encode information, how these patterns of activity are formed, and how they support (and obstruct) behavior.
